<lore>
Looking at the sandstone transport pipe suggests that it could transfer something other than items. Ramming a stick into it didn't do much but adding redstone too helped conduct Forge Energy along it.

The sandstone conductive pipe can transfer power from neighbouring conductive pipes to other conductive pipes.

<chapter name="Information"/>
Will connect to any conductive pipe, but not any neighbouring blocks (whether they accept Forge Energy or not).

Pulling the stick out again turns the pipe back into a normal sandstone transport pipe. Destructive process for the stick however.

Sandstone conductive pipes can be uncrafted back into normal sandstone transport pipes.

<lore>
After spilling some paint on a sandstone transport pipe, it appears sticks and redstone don't remove it. 
</lore>
<no_lore>
Sandstone conductive pipes can be made from coloured transport pipes too.

This process can also be undone similar to colourless conductive pipes.

If the flow within the pipe ever appears to be stuck, or in a similarly incorrect state, a right click with a wrench will force a visual update.
Sticks are not perfect for Forge Energy transfer after all.
