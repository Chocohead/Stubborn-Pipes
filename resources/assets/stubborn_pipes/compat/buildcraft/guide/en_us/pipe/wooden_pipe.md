Looking at the wooden transport pipe suggests that it could accept something other than items. Ramming a stick into it didn't do much but adding redstone too helped conduct Forge Energy along it.

The wooden conductive pipe can accept power from neighbouring Forge Energy emitters.

Doesn't connect to other wooden conductive pipes or "emerald" conductive pipes, but will connect to any other conductive pipe.

Pulling the stick out again turns the pipe back into a normal wooden transport pipe. Destructive process for the stick however.

Wooden conductive pipes can be uncrafted back into normal wooden transport pipes.

<lore>
After spilling some paint on a wooden transport pipe, it appears sticks and redstone don't remove it. 
</lore>
<no_lore>
Wooden conductive pipes can be made from coloured transport pipes too.

This process can also be undone similar to colourless conductive pipes.

If the flow within the pipe ever appears to be stuck, or in a similarly incorrect state, a right click with a wrench will force a visual update.
Sticks are not perfect for Forge Energy transfer after all.
