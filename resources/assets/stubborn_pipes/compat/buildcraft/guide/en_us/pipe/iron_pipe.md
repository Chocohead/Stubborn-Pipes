Looking at the iron transport pipe suggests that it could transfer something other than items. Ramming a stick into it didn't do much but adding redstone too helped conduct Forge Energy along it.

The iron conductive pipe can transfer power from neighbouring conductive pipes to other conductive pipes or Forge Energy acceptors.

<chapter name="Information"/>
Will connect to any conductive pipe, as well as any neighbouring block that accepts Forge Energy. Right clicking with a wrench changes the maximum bandwidth.

Pulling the stick out again turns the pipe back into a normal iron transport pipe. Destructive process for the stick however. 
</lore>
<no_lore>

Iron conductive pipes can be uncrafted back into normal iron transport pipes.

<lore>
After spilling some paint on a iron transport pipe, it appears sticks and redstone don't remove it. 
</lore>
<no_lore>
Iron conductive pipes can be made from coloured transport pipes too.

This process can also be undone similar to colourless conductive pipes.

<chapter name="Disclaimer"/>
If the flow within the pipe ever appears to be stuck, or in a similarly incorrect state, a right click with a wrench will force a visual update.
Sticks are not perfect for Forge Energy transfer after all.
