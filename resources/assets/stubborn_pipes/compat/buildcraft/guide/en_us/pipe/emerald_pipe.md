Looking at the wooden diamond transport pipe suggests that it could accept something other than items. Ramming a stick into it didn't do much but adding redstone too helped conduct Forge Energy along it. Made the pipe a quite dirty too, perhaps this is was a bad idea...

The "emerald" conductive pipe can accept power from neighbouring Forge Energy emitters. Doesn't actually contain any emeralds.

<chapter name="Information"/>
Doesn't connect to other "emerald" conductive pipes or wooden conductive pipes, but will connect to any other conductive pipe.

Pulling the stick out again turns the pipe back into a normal wooden diamond transport pipe. Destructive process for the stick however.

"Emerald" conductive pipes can be uncrafted back into normal wooden diamond transport pipes.

Disappointingly despite the dirtiness, emeralds don't seem to come out no matter how many sticks are inserted and removed. Or how much energy is transfered. Although it can transfer a lot of energy compared to a wooden conductive pipe anyway.

After spilling some paint on a wooden diamond transport pipe, it appears sticks and redstone don't remove it. Dirtiness is masked somewhat.

"Emerald" conductive pipes can be made from coloured transport pipes too.

This process can also be undone similar to colourless conductive pipes.

If the flow within the pipe ever appears to be stuck, or in a similarly incorrect state, a right click with a wrench will force a visual update.
Sticks are not perfect for Forge Energy transfer after all.

Emeralds not included.
