## Stubborn Pipes

* Adds FU transfering pipes to compliment [BuildCraft's](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft) kinesis pipes.
* Adds an MJ and FU Tester Block which can act as a constant source or a sink
* Allows just the guide book to be reloaded once the game has started using `F3-T` whilst it is open.

As requested for a long time, BuildCraft style pipes that don't just do MJ.
Somewhat experimental, due to using largely what BuildCraft is currently using for its own kinesis pipes.
These don't convert to or from MJ, BuildCraft is revamping MJ at some point thus patience is required.

Documentation is provided within the BuildCraft guide book in the Forge Energy Transport section.
